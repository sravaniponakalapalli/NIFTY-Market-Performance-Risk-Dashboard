## ❗ Business Problem

Investors frequently focus only on:

However, they often ignore:

- Volatility
- Drawdowns
- Risk-adjusted performance
- Market breadth

This can lead to poor investment decisions and unrealistic expectations.

The challenge was to create a **single analytical view** that integrates both performance and risk.
